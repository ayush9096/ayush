I am currently working at [Mihup](https://www.mihup.com) on Deep Learning for Edge Devices. My expertize spans across a wide variety of topics like Embedded Neural Networks, Speech Recognition Systems and Text to Speech Systems.

Previously I did a research internship in [I3D Lab, CPDM, IISc Bangalore](https://cambum.net/I3DLab/news.htm) under Prof. [Pradipta Biswas](https://www.cambum.net/). There I worked on developing a WebCam Based Eye Gaze Tracker on Browsers for users with severe speech and motor impairment, for which I also published a paper at [Springer] (https://link.springer.com/), [Comparing Two WebCam-Based Eye Gaze Trackers for Users with Severe Speech and Motor Impairment](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-5977-4_54?fbclid=IwAR0-sCXC5Mo-3teGH7qZO7bwbNCDrrJishwGEvhBpx4Zy-4Fh9GIQiHebK4/).

My subject of interest broadly lies in the area of Aritificial Intelligence for Edge Devices, Entrepreneurship. Off the work, I am starting writing technical articles.
